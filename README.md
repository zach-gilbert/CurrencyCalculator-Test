<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This mini-project was designed with the sole intent of practicing Selenium by accessing a public website and providing and retrieving data.

### Built With

- Java,

- [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium),

- [Selenium WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager)

### Purpose

This project intializes Chrome WebDriver with Ublock Origin and attempts to access [Calculator.com](https://calculator.com). From there, it begins by navigating to the currency conversion calculator webpage and identifying the currency USD textbox element. Afterwards, it provides a random value which in turn is converted to various currencies. The data is then retrieved from the page and printed to console.
